## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** installed
2. **Redis** running (for Celery background tasks)
3. **Qdrant** running (local or cloud, for job matching)
4. **Mistral API Key** (for AI features) - Get from https://console.mistral.ai/

## Step 1: Clone & Install

Open PowerShell in your projects directory:

```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Pratham-Dabhane/AlignCV.git
cd AlignCV

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Mistral AI (Required for AI features)
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here

# Qdrant (Required for job matching)
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=  # Optional for cloud

# Redis (Required for background tasks)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Email (Optional - for notifications)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@aligncv.com

# Database (SQLite default, PostgreSQL for production)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./aligncv.db
```

---

## Step 3: Start Backend (V2 API)

Open a terminal and run:

```powershell
# Option 1: Using helper script (recommended)
python start_server.py

# Option 2: Manual start
cd backend
uvicorn v2.app_v2:app --reload --port 8001
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8001

```

**Keep this terminal running!**

---

## Step 4: Start Celery Worker

Open a **NEW** terminal and run:

```powershell

celery -A backend.v2.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

## Step 5: Start Frontend

Open a **NEW** terminal and run:

```powershell
cd frontend
streamlit run app_v2.py --server.port 8502
```

You should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
